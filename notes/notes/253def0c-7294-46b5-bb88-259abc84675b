* Introduction

** Next generation sequencing is great for diagnosis
Over the decade next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a mainstay in clinical diagnosis of rare and complex diseases.
[cite:@100000Genomes2021]

** NOTE There are a lot of VUS
Various NGS methods utilized in clinical diagnosis, whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and clinical exome sequncing (CES) has diagnostic yield of around 30% and higher rate of 50-60% in consanguineous families.
[cite:@trujillanoClinicalExomeSequencing2017; @vandersandenPerformanceGenomeSequencing2022; @al-dewikClinicalExomeSequencing2019; @tsangDiagnosticValueWholeexome2020; @yavarnaHighDiagnosticYield2015]

** NOTE Reanalysis of these VUS variants can improve the diagnosis rate
However undiagnosed variants

** Secondary findings
Another important aspect we need the keep track of is secondary findings. ACMG, updates their recommanded gene list for secondary findings. Any variant in these genes can also be kept track of.

** NOTE What is variant annotation
One of the main step of genetic diagnosis with sequencing is variant annotation which adds contextual information like transcript id, gene symbol; population information like allele frequencies; clinical and literature information like disease and phenotype associations.
[cite:@mclarenEnsemblVariantEffect2016]

When the variants are first called with a variant caller, what we have is a genomic location of the variant and no other information.
Variants' clinical significance are decided in light of these additional information (annotations).
[cite:@richardsStandardsGuidelinesInterpretation2015]

** NOTE Periodical reanalysis improves the diagnosis rate

= becomes more available more genes and variants are associated with diseases=

** NOTE Diagnosis rate improves because databases get updated.
Databases used in bioinformatics gets bigger as more data is generated
[cite:@phan2020a]
and becomes more diversified as new methodologies are developed to better identify human variation.
[cite:@korenNovoAssemblyHaplotyperesolved2018; @oliverHighDefinitionElectronicGenome2017; @kronenbergHighresolutionComparativeAnalysis2018]
Paving the way of studies that give insight to biology underlying human diseases.
[cite:@replogleMappingInformationrichGenotypephenotype2022]

** NOTE We need to keep track of the changes of these updates related to our variants.

** NOTE There are tools that does this and git is one of them
Version control can be a tedious experience in any iterative process.
Whatever its writing a paper, programming or documentation.
This issue becomes amplified when there are multiple people making contributions or working together.

Linux kernel is such project with thousands of contributors and millions of source code line to keep track of.
** NOTE The tool git has been conceived to work in distrubuted manner and make it easier for iterative work of many people easier.
The name git holds no special meaning and is chosen to be pronounceable and like other three letter UNIX commands like awk and sed.
Since its first conception from 2005, it has seen widespread use in software engineering and became a staple tool.

** NOTE in this work we use git as a bioinformatics tools to keep tracks of variant changes in variant annotation.

Closely to life sciences, git is used to version control bioinformatics tools however not itself as a bioinformatic tool.
Here we use git to track changes in variant annotation.

* Material Method
Variant annotation process requires no local setup and all the annotation are performed using the API's.
Variant added are commited to the git repo.
Following API's are set by default Ensembl VEP, intervar, clingen, pubmed, litvar
We start tracking variants that are reported as VUS in these papers and Clinvar with our tool.
After adding the variants with their SPDI represtation they're annotated and

* Results
We found X of the variants are now classified as benign and Y of the variants are classified as VUS.
Z of these genes are now associated with disease and variants found in these genes should be re evaluated.
W of the variants in secondary findings genes are now pathogenic.

* Discussion
The most frequent changes that effect a genetic test result happen in the annotation and subsequent classification phases.
Every passing day amount of data generated by sequencing gets larger and reanalyses of these variants become more challenging as a bulk.

Secondary findings are important for genetic counseling.
The value of the software will show itself when the VUS' are classified to either benign and pathogenic classifications.
Having notifications on these annotation/classification changes would allow for a prompt health care decisions.

Version control tools haven't got much traction out of software engineering.
Using git can be an overwhelming ordeal for anyone not familiar with programming.
[cite:@AskHNWhy]
However we can see that its start being adapted in other fields like tracking changes in law corpus.
[cite:@Lawxml2022; @DeutscheBundesgesetzeUnd2022]
Variant tracking framework using git allows for scalability.
