Sequence motifs are knobs and switches that allow organisms to control levels of RNA and protein products.
They work as handles for regulatory proteins to interact with the sequences they control.
They are also a primary target for evolutionary processes to act on to fine-tune the phenotypes.

This is a simple implementation of Gibbs motif sampler algorithm described in [[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/resources/mit7_91js14_lecture9/][class 7.91 lecture 9]].
Gibbs motif sampler is a kind of Monte Carlo algorithm which relies on repeated random sampling of data.
Algorithm is implemented in pure python and pandas and matplotlib only used to plot the results.
Below code sets up the virtual environment.

* Implementation

** Creating the sample data
*** Creating Sequences
We can create our test data by using random module.
First lets create some sequences. For this we need 4 variables:
- Alphabet which is A, G, C, T for DNA
- Weights for our bases meaning how frequent we are gonna see them
- How long we want our sequences to be

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
alphabet = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']
seq_weights = [.25, .25, .25, .25]
seq_length = 60
#+END_SRC

We can loop over the number of sequences we want and use the random.choices to
pick bases which returns a list that we can join into a string.
Lets create 10 random sequences.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
import random

for _ in range(10):
    seq = "".join(
        random.choices(population=alphabet, weights=seq_weights, k=seq_length)
    )
    print(seq)

*** Creating motifs

There is a [[https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html][standard definition from UIPAC]] to represent multiple bases in single character.
In order the create a motif I want to enter a motif logo that is represented by UIPAC codes like =ABCDMRS= with weights for possible bases in each location.


We can represent the UIPAC codes in our program as a simple dictionary.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
IUPACcodes = {
    "A": ["A"],
    "C": ["C"],
    "G": ["G"],
    "T": ["T"],
    "M": ["A", "C"],
    "R": ["A", "G"],
    "W": ["A", "T"],
    "S": ["C", "G"],
    "Y": ["C", "T"],
    "K": ["G", "T"],
    "V": ["A", "C", "G"],
    "H": ["A", "C", "T"],
    "D": ["A", "G",
    "B": ["C", "G", "T"],
    "N": ["A", "C", "G", "T"],
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


To create a motif we will need two parameters:
- motif logo
- and respective weight of the bases

In example below, first list of =[1]= corresponds to first =A= in the logo.
Second list of =[0.8, 0.2]= corresponds to code =K= which stands for either G
or T. Here 0.8 is weight of the base G and 0.2 is weight of the base T.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
motif_logo = 'AKCYTSG'
motif_weights = [
    [1],
    [0.8, 0.2],
    [1],
    [0.8, 0.2],
    [1],
    [0.8, 0.2],
    [1],
]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


We can now generate random motifs with some variability.  Here we loop over the
logo translate them to the bases and pick one of the bases with given weights
using random.choices.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
def generate_motif(logo, weights):
    """

        motif = "".join(
            (
                motif[:index],
                random.choices(bases, weights[index])[0],
                motif[index + 1 :],
            )
        )
    return motif

#+END_SRC

*** Adding motifs to sequences
Lastly we insert the motifs randomly into the sequences. Here we return the =insert_ind= so we can see where we inserted the motifs.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
def insert_motif(sequence, motif):
    '''
    Replace a random part of the given sequence with the given motif sequence
    '''
    insert_ind = random.randrange(len(sequence) - len(motif))
    sequence = ''.join((sequence[:insert_ind], motif, sequence[insert_ind + len(motif):]))
    return insert_ind, sequence
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


*** Putting it all together

Lets create 120 sequences and print first 10 of them. Here we can align using
the =insert_ind= returned by =insert_motif= function to see the motifs clearly.
Also to make the sample data reproducible we set random.seed here so we get the
same sequences with same motifs inserted in the same positions.

import random
random.seed(0)

** Finding the motif

*** Algorithm outline
Lecture summarizes the algorithm as such:
#+begin_quote
The Gibbs Sampling Algorithm In Words

Given N sequences of length L and desired motif width W:

1) Choose a starting position in each sequence at random:

   a1 in seq 1, a2 in seq 2, …, aN in sequence N

2) Choose a sequence at random from the set (say, seq 1).

3) Make a weight matrix model of width W from the sites in all sequences
   except the one chosen in step 2.

4) Assign a probability to each position in seq 1 using the weight matrix
   model constructed in step 3:

    p = { p1, p2, p3, …, pL-W+1 }

5) Sample a starting position in seq 1 based on this probability
   distribution and set a1 to this new position.

6) Choose a sequence at random from the set (say, seq 2).

7) Make a weight matrix model of width W from the sites in all sequences
   except the one chosen in step 6.

8) Assign a probability to each position in seq 2 using the weight matrix
   model constructed in step 7.

9) Sample a starting position in seq 2 based on this dist.

10) Repeat until convergence (of positions or motif model)

Lawrence et al. Science 1993
#+end_quote

Its outline implementation in code looks like this. This function gets a list of
sequences and length of the sequence we are searching for and returns the
weighted model matrix which corresponds to the logo of the discovered motif.

Here we keep track of the new position mentioned in step 5 in =max_scores= and =max_indices=.
First for loop corresponds to step 10 and =if max_indices_previous ​=​= max_indices= checks
for convergence meaning it stops if we're not founding any new locations.

*Second* and *sixth* steps say to select sequences at random however we just go over
the sequences in order because its same as picking them as randomly. This way we
can just loop over them too which is what we do with the inner for loop.

For steps *third* and *seventh* we create the weight matrix with =pspm= function
and for steps *fourth* and *eighth* we use the =calculate_probability= function.
We add the new starting position to =max_indices= list if score is higher then
what we see before for that sequence in =max_scores= list. We use the previous
=max_indices= when sampling new sequences.

We return the wmm and the max_indices as a result.


#+BEGIN_SRC python
def find_motif(query_seqs, motif_length):
    max_indices = [0 for _ in range(len(query_seqs))]
    max_scores = [0 for _ in range(len(query_seqs))]

        max_indices_previous = max_indices.copy()
        for i, query_seq in enumerate(query_seqs):
            if i == len(query_seqs):
                break
            sample_indices = max_indices[:i] + [random.randrange(len(sequence) - motif_length) for sequence in query_seqs[i:]]
            samples = [seq[j:j + motif_length] for j, seq in zip(sample_indices, query_seqs[:i] + query_seqs[i + 1:])]
            wmm = pspm(samples)
            slice_scores = calculate_probability(query_seq, wmm)

*** Weighted Model Matrix

Weighted model matrix or position specific probability model implemented here as
a list of dictionaries is a model of our motif with probabilities of possible bases in
each location.
This function takes sampled sequences (in length of our motif) and returns the
frequeny of bases in each location.

#+END_SRC

*** Calculate probability
We use a sliding window and calculate the probability of our =wmm= against the
background bias.  Background bias here is the probability of seeing each base in
the given sequence.  We use the =sequence_slice= function and loop over every
slice of the sequence. For every slice we calculate the score by dividing
probability of seeing given base in wmm to probability of seeing in background.

#+RESULTS:

*Running the algorithm*

Here we don't need the =insert_ind= from =motif_seqs= and only need the sequences themselves.
We get the sequences in the list =query_seqs=.
Here we don't want the set the random.seed since this algorithm relies on running it multiple times.
Because initial sampling is random results will be different every time.

** Parameters affecting the results
There are few variables that affect the results. Which we can test by tweaking parameters above.
- *Length of the motif* Longer motifs are easier to find.

Here we have a motif with double the size.

- *Entropy/information of the motif* Motifs with a more conserved sequences are easier to find.

Here we have a motif with lower entropy. Because we change the motif weights to 1, our motif is =AGCCTCG=.

- *Contrast with the background* it is easier to find an A-T rich motif in a G-C rich sequence.

Here we have GC rich sequences with AT rich motifs. Even though our motif is shorther it is much easier to find.

* Trying it out with real data

Lets try to use our new program with real data.
Download human genome and annotation file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results export both
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/analysis_set/chm13v2.0.fa.gz
wget http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/hprc/y1_freeze/GCA_009914755.4/GCA_009914755.4_genes.gff3.gz
#+END_SRC

We are going to extract 60 bases around end of the 1000 random protein coding exons. First need to get the exon end position for these genes from the annotation file.
Easiest way to achieve is with a shell script like below:
1. zcat uncompresses the file
2. grep -v skips the header lines
3. grep ENSP gets annotations with only the proteins
4. after that we get the exon entries with positive orientation and print them with the chromosome and the end position.
5. shuf to randomly sample the whole genome.
6. awk to get chromosome (with chr prefix) start and end positions.
7. lastly head to get first 1000 entries and write them to a file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results export both
zcat GCA_009914755.4_genes.gff3.gz | grep -v '^#' | grep "ENSP" | awk -F"\t" '{if ($3 = "exon" && $7 == "+") {print $1, $5}}' | sort -s -k1,1 -k2,2n -u | shuf | awk '{printf  "chr%s:%s-%s\n", $1, $2-10, $2+49}' | head -n 1000 > sample_positions.txt
#+END_SRC

To extract the actual sequences from the genome we are going to use samtools. After indexing the genome =faidx= can retrieve sequences with given coordinates.
We can have samtools read the sample_positions.txt file we created and write the outputs to =sample.fa=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results export both
samtools faidx chm13v2.0.fa.gz
samtools faidx chm13v2.0.fa.gz -r sample_positions.txt -o sample.fa
#+END_SRC

We need to read the fasta file.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session tutorial :results output :exports both
with open("sample.fa") as f:
    query_seqs = ["".join(entry.splitlines()[1:]).upper() for entry in f.read().split('>')[1:]]
    # query_seqs = [line for line f.read().splitlines() if not line.startswith(">")]
print(query_seqs[:12])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['ACATCGAGGAGTGCGTGCGGCGGCAACTGAGGGCCACGGGCCGCCCGCCCAGCACGGAGC', 'AGAACCAGAAGGGTAAGATTACATGTGGGCATAAATTGTTAAAAGCATAGTTATAATGAT', 'CTCAAGGCCAGCGAGCCGGGACTCTTCTCGGTGGGTCTGCACACGGGCGAGGTGCGCACG', 'CGGGCTGCGAGGTAAGAGCGCGCGACCCGCAGCGGCAGATGCACGAACCAGAACGGCCGG', 'ATGTCTATAAGGTGAGCGCCCCCCGGCGCCGAGCTGAGCCCGCTCCGTGTGCGCCCGGGT', 'CCAGGATCCAGGTGAGGGCCCGCTGCGTTCGCAAGTGCGCGCTGGAGCGGAGGCGCTGCG', 'CATCTGCTCAGGTGGGCCTTCAAGAACTTGGGCTCACTCTCTTGGGGTGGAGTTTGCTCC', 'CAAACAAGATGGTAAGTGTCAAAGGAAAATGGCTCCAGATAGAATAAAGGAGGCAAAGAA', 'TTGAAATCAGGGTAAGATGCGAAGCTGGTCGGCCAGGCCAAGGTCTACGACCAGAGTCTG', 'GACATTTAACGGTGAGGTGTATGTTTTATAATTATGTTACCTTCTTAGAAGTGTATTTTT', 'ACTTAGCCAAGGTGAGCTTCTTACCCCGTCCAGGCAGGACCCTAATCCTGGAGCTAGGCA', 'CCCCTCTCTGTGTGAGTATGGGGACCGCTCTCTGTCAGATGCTCTACCAGCAGCAGGGGG']

We can just pass the sequences to our function. For the motif size lets pick 8.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results file graphics :file "5prime_splice_site.png"  :session tutorial :exports both
wmm, max_indices = find_motif(random.choices(query_seqs, k=100), 8)
plot_logo(wmm, "5prime_splice_site.png")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:5prime_splice_site.png]]

Here what we are looking for is the [[https:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing][5´ splice sites]] with the motif =G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U=.
