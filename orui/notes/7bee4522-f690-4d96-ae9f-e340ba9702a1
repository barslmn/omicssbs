* Heterochrony
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (39 0.4391046741277156 . 0.14321357285429143)
:END:
Difference in the timing of development in descendants compared to their ancestors.
Ontogenetic schedule of development can potentially produce tremendous phenotypic diversity.
Heterochrony involves oth changes in the relative timing in the appearance of the trait (/event heterochronies/) and/or differences in the relative amount of time for a feature to develop (/rate heterochronies/).
Event heterochronies are single point of development (/onset or offset/).
Rate heterochronies are differences in the degree of developmental change between at least two time points(/rate/).
Both rate and event can be accelerated or decelerated in descendants compare to ancestors.

* Fin-to-Limb development
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (892 0.5378538512179065 . 0.16516966067864272)
:END:
Ectodermal jacket of the fin bud has a ridge along the dorsoventral border called apical ectodermal ridge (AER), which elongates into the apical fold (AF).
Tetrapod limb bud never undergo this transformation, suggestting that epithelial changes might be the key to understand the evolutionary developmental mechanism behind fin-to-limb transition.

Morphologically limb skeleton made out of stylopod (humerus/femur), zeugopod (radius/tibia and ulna/fibula), and autopod (carpals/tarsals, metacarpals/metatarsals, and phalanges)
Tetropod limbs and paired finds are homologous.

* Lateral plate mesoderm
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (896 0.2467105263157895 . 0.2310379241516966)
:END:
Both endochondral bones and dermal bones are derived from lateral plate mesoderm (LPM).

* Apical ectodermal ridge
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (896 0.4276315789473684 . 0.560379241516966)
:END:
Both fin and limb buds have an ectodermal ridge structure running alond the entire dorsoventral border on the bud.

In tetrapods the AER is maintained throughout the limb bud outgrowth.
In teleost AER is retained until fin bud appears than turns into the AF.
AER plays role in PD axis and results in elongation of the limb/fin.

* Zone of polarizing activity

:NOTER_PAGE: (896 0.6368421052631579 . 0.3408183632734531)
:END:
formation of three-dimensional pattern depends on two signaling centers: AER and ZPA.

ZPA, is an aera of the posterior limb mesenchyme and has and inductive activity of the AP.
Shh protein plays role in ZPA.
/Shh/ expression  in the ZPA is induced by RA signaling from trunk.
Expression of /ssh/ is localized to the posterior fin bud.

* Homeobox genes
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (898 0.27960526315789475 . 0.40668662674650696)
:END:
5' /HoxA/ and /HoxD/ cluster genes regulate downstream patterning.
