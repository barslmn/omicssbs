This page indexes a collection of tools available as web applications for
bioinformaticians and geneticists. The tools automate various tasks that often
are performed manually. The source code for this page is available on <a
    href="https://github.com/barslmn/omicsbs">GitHub</a>.

<h3>
    <a href="{% url 'bioscripts:var2texshade' %}">Var2TexShade</a>
</h3>
<p>
    This tools visualizes homology of given protein change e.g. NP_001501.2:p.Arg121Leu using texshade.
    Texshade is a <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/texshade">latex package</a> for setting nucleotide and peptide
    alignments. Multiple sequence alignments for the proteins are retrieved from <a
        href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene">NCBI homologene database</a>.
    The tool is useful for visualizing a variant on evulotionary conserved regions. The source code is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/barslmn/bioscripts/tree/master/modules/var2texshade">GitHub</a>.

    <a href="{% url 'bioscripts:crosssymbolchecker' %}">Cross-symbol checker</a>
    <img src="{% static 'bioscripts/img/crosssymbolchecker.svg' %}" alt="Cross Symbol Checker Logo">
</h3>
<p>
    This tool maps aliases, and previous or withdrawn symbols to current approved
    HGNC symbols as well as check for any entries that are not gene symbols and fix
    capitalizations. Ensembl and RefSeq annotation files sometimes use previous or
    alias symbols. This tool also cross checks against Ensembl and NCBI annotation
    files for different genome versions and shows which gene symbols used. This way
    an accurate gene set can be utilized to avoid false negatives in the variant
    discovery process. The source code is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/barslmn/cross-symbol-checker">GitHub</a>.

    <a href="{% url 'bioscripts:prism' %}">PRiSm</a>
    <img src="{% static 'bioscripts/img/prism.png' %}" alt="Polygenic Risk Score Simulation">
</h3>
<p>
    This tool simulates genotypes for control and case groups and performs logistic regression on score.
    The tools is served at <a href="https://barslmn.shinyapps.io/PRiSm/">shinyapps</a>.
